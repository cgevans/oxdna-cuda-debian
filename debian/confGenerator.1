.SH NAME
.PP
confGenerator - basic oxDNA configuration generator
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]confGenerator\f[R] <\f[I]input_file\f[R]> <\f[I]box\f[R]>
[\f[I]key\f[R]=\f[I]value\f[R]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
confGenerator can be used to generate simple initial configurations.
.PP
When used to generate DNA or RNA configurations it is recommended to
always set generate_consider_bonded_interactions = true in the input
file.
.PP
In addition to the input file, confGenerator takes another mandatory
argument whose meaning depends on its value.
It specifies the simulation box if it is a single number larger than 2
(in which case the simulation box is assumed to be cubic) or if it is an
x-separated triplet of numbers that specify the length of the edges of
the box (which is assumed to be a cuboid).
By contrast, the second mandatory argument is interpreted as a number
density if it is smaller than 2.
