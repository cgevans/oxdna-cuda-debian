oxdna-cuda (3.4.2-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Initial release (Closes: #1019890)
  * Patched to use system pybind11-dev and nhlohmann-json3-dev.
  * Still uses embedded copies of exprtk and fast_double_parsen in
    src/extern. Both these are single headers, and are similarly
    embedded in other Debian packages.
  * Uses RPATH for a private shared library.  This is set during cmake
    installation of binaries, and by a bit of a roundabout method for
    the oxpy Python package, 'installing' it and then moving it back
    into the build directory to be installed during the oxpy Python
    package installation.
  * CUDA compilation should support architures 5.0, 5.2, 6.0, 6.1, 7.0,
    and 7.5.
  * Man pages added, though they mostly point to html documentation.
  * html documentation links javascript, and tries to avoid external
    mathjax use.  One external iframe, to oxView, remains.
